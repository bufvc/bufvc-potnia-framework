* Templates folder
This folder (and the templates/ folders inside each module) contain files for displaying content to end-users.

Template files can be edited by designers. It should not be necessary for designers to edit files outside 
the templates directories.

The main design constraints are:
 - It should be easy for designers to find and edit the files, which means the majority of files 
   are plain PHP
 - Performance 
 
 The main techniques used are:
 
 1. Include a template file directly
 
 2. Look for template files in the module-specific directories and fall back to the global template
 
 3. Use functions or objects
 
 Functions are used for repetitious code such as displaying drop-down lists in queries.
 
 Objects are used where performance is an issue, e.g. in the results list where including a PHP file 100 times 
 would impact performance.
