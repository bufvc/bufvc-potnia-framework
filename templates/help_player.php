<p>Audio clips are included in the records you are searching. There are three ways to play the audio clips.</p>

<p>The <b>Simple Player</b> included in each clip has play or pause, and volume, controls. The slider bar in the centre of the player lets you move forwards or backwards in the audio clip. Leaving the page will stop the audio.</p>

<p>The <b>Popup Player</b> lets you listen to one item, while continuing to search. It also allows more detailed control of the audio clips.</p>

<p>Click 'Play In New Window' and the Popup Player will appear in a new window or tab, in which you will find the same controls as the Simple Player. The Popup Player also allows you to see the percentage of the clip which is loaded, and when this is complete the overall time of the clip. At the left hand side, the current time into the clip is shown.</p>

<p>You can <b>download</b> a file, saving a copy from the website to your own computer.</p>

<p>Using a PC, either click the 'download' link and follow instructions your computer gives. Alternatively, let your mouse hover over 'download', click the right hand button on your mouse, and select 'Save Target' from the menu which appears.</p>

<p>Please note that different internet browsers - for example, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Firefox - handle downloads in different ways; as do your personal settings on your own computer.</p>
